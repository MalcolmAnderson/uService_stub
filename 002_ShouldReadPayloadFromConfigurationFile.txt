As an adminstrator of the real service
I want the payload to be loaded from a configuration file
So that changing the payload doesn't require a code change.

cat foo.config      // or appropriate configuration file name
payload: bar3       // or appropriate configuration file syntax

curl http://localhost:4100/foo/
bar3

change foo.config payload line to Hi Bob
payload: Hi Bob     // figure out how to appropriately handle spaces in config items

restart service

curl http://localhost:4100/foo/
Hi Bob
