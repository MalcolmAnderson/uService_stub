As an adminstrator of the real service
I want to be able to change the payload with a service call
So that I don't have to stop the service to impact the results.


curl http://localhost:4100/foo/
bar3

curl http://localhost:4100/fooConfigure?payload=new%20payload
new payload

curl http://localhost:4100/foo/
new payload
