Purpose
                Attempt to do a rolling restart of a service while changing logging levels

Agenda
                Picking BFF or another service
                                Check the level of logging
                                Ping the service load balancer to confirm connection
                                Ping an instance of the service
                                Change the log level of the service
                                Issue a restart command to a single instance 
                                                Spam both the instance and the service load balance in an attempt to get a 404 or other failure
                Expected results
                                Instance is not available, but load balance service is uninterrupted
                Continue process for other instances
                Attempt process using the rolling strategy

Resources
                The subsection Rolling App Deployments section of the cloudfoundy wiki has a section on doing a 
rolling restart on an app that appears to fit the use case
https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/devguide/deploy-apps/rolling-deploy.html
                Restart an App

To restart your app without downtime, run the appropriate command below. Restart 
an app to apply configuration updates that require a restart, such as environment 
variables or service bindings.
cf CLI v7:
Run:
                cf7 restart APP-NAME --strategy rolling
Where APP-NAME is the name of the app.
                
                There is a 2017 ticket with cloudfoundry where the functionality and a manual workaround is discussed
                                https://github.com/cloudfoundry/cli/issues/1064
In the meantime, you can either restart the instances one by one manually (or in a script) with 
cf restart-app-instance) 
or search for a CLI plugin (e.g. https://github.com/Comcast/cf-recycle-plugin) to do it for you.
