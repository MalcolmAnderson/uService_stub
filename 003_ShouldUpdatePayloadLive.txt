As an adminstrator of the real service
I want the service to check for config changes every 5 seconds and reconfigure itself if file has change
So that changing the payload doesn't require a service restart

cat foo.config      // or appropriate configuration file name
payload: bar3       // or appropriate configuration file syntax

curl http://localhost:4100/foo/
bar3

change foo.config payload line to Hi Bob
payload: Hi Bob     // figure out how to appropriately handle spaces in config items

save configuration file

curl http://localhost:4100/foo/
Hi Bob
